These files constitute the game logic of the Mancala game. The game is not yet playable, for I still have to make the GUI. 
The game logic has been implemented through Object Oriented design and Test-driven development. 
The Mancala board is created from the first cube till there are 14, two of which have the special title and abilities of Kalaha. The SuperCube class is an abstract class which cube and kalaha both inherit from. 
All cubes start with 4 stones, and the object of the game is by passing allong the stones to get as much stones as possible in your own Kalaha. If one row is empty, the game ends.
